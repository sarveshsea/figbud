# FigBud Fixes Applied

## 1. ✅ LoadingInsights Display Fixed
**Problem**: LoadingInsights component wasn't showing because it used Once UI components that don't render in Figma plugin environment.

**Solution**: Replaced all Once UI components with native HTML/Tailwind CSS:
- `<Flex>` → `<div className="flex ...">`
- `<Text>` → `<span>` or `<p>` with Tailwind classes
- `<Card>` → `<div>` with custom styling
- `<Badge>` → `<span>` with badge styling

**Result**: Now shows progressive loading messages:
- 0-3s: "FigBud AI is thinking..."
- 3-8s: "Analyzing your request..."
- 8-15s: "Searching for the best AI model..." + process cards
- 15-25s: "Processing with advanced AI..." + model info
- And more...

## 2. ✅ Rate Limit Tracking Added
**Problem**: Free OpenRouter models were getting 429 rate limit errors immediately.

**Solution**: Added rate limit tracking in enhanced-ai-provider.ts:
- Tracks rate limit headers from API responses
- Stores remaining requests and reset time
- Skips models that are rate limited
- Shows rate limit info in error messages

## 3. ✅ Database Schema Fix
**Problem**: Supabase was missing the `conversation_id` column.

**Solution**: Fixed the schema in `supabase-schema.sql`.

**To Apply**:
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy and run the contents of `supabase-schema.sql`
4. Go to Settings → API → Click "Reload Schema Cache"

## 4. ✅ YouTube API Configuration
**Problem**: YouTube search returning 0 results.

**Solution**: Created `YOUTUBE_API_SETUP.md` with step-by-step guide.

**Note**: The app works without YouTube API - uses mock data as fallback.

## 5. ✅ Message Formatting Fixed
**Problem**: AI responses showing raw JSON instead of formatted text.

**Solution**: 
- Backend now parses AI response and extracts message
- Frontend uses pre-parsed fields
- Added rendering for:
  - Step-by-step instructions
  - Teacher notes
  - Suggestions
  - Model info

## Build Instructions

To build with all fixes:
```bash
./build-simple.sh
```

Or manually:
```bash
npm run build:figma
```

## Testing Checklist

1. **LoadingInsights**:
   - [ ] Send a message and watch loading state
   - [ ] Should see progressive messages, not just dots
   - [ ] Process cards should appear after 8 seconds

2. **Message Formatting**:
   - [ ] AI responses should show formatted text
   - [ ] Step-by-step instructions in green boxes
   - [ ] Teacher notes in accent color boxes

3. **Rate Limiting**:
   - [ ] Check server logs for rate limit tracking
   - [ ] Should fallback to DeepSeek when free models hit limits

4. **Database**:
   - [ ] Apply schema to Supabase
   - [ ] Check that messages are saved without errors

## Known Issues

- `componentVariantManager.ts` has TypeScript errors (not critical for chat functionality)
- Build shows performance warnings (normal for Figma plugins)

## Next Steps

1. Apply database schema to Supabase
2. Configure YouTube API key (optional)
3. Ensure you have DeepSeek API key for reliable AI responses
4. Test all features in Figma

The plugin is now ready with improved loading transparency, proper message formatting, and better error handling!
