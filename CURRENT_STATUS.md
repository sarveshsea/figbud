# FigBud Current Status üöÄ

## ‚úÖ What's Working:
1. **Backend API is running** and responding to requests
2. **Cascading AI models** - tries free models first (Llama ‚Üí Gemma ‚Üí DeepSeek)
3. **DeepSeek off-hours discount** is active (50% off)
4. **API integration** between plugin and backend

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues to Fix:

### 1. **Chat Response Still Shows Raw JSON**
The backend is returning properly formatted text, but it's still appearing as JSON in the chat.
- Backend returns: `text: "Great choice! Let's create..."`
- But UI shows: `{"message": "Great choice!...}`

**Likely cause**: The response might be getting double-encoded somewhere.

### 2. **Free OpenRouter Models Failing**
- Llama model: 402 (Payment Required) 
- Gemma model: 502 (Bad Gateway)
- Your account has $4.99 credits, so it should work

**Possible issues**:
- Free tier models might require specific account settings
- The 502 error suggests OpenRouter might be having issues with Gemma

### 3. **Supabase Not Logging**
- Getting "Invalid API key" errors
- You need the `service_role` key from Supabase dashboard (not anon key)
- Go to: Settings ‚Üí API ‚Üí service_role (secret)

## üîß Next Steps:

1. **Reload plugin completely** in Figma to test JSON fix
2. **Get correct Supabase service_role key** from dashboard
3. **Check OpenRouter account settings** for free model access

The core functionality is working - just need these final tweaks!
