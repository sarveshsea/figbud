# FigBud Widget Import Guide

## Steps to Import the Widget in Figma

### 1. Clean Previous Installation
- Open Figma Desktop App (not browser)
- Go to **Menu â†’ Widgets â†’ Development â†’ Manage widgets in development**
- Remove any existing FigBud widgets if present
- Also check your widgets panel and remove any FigBud instances

### 2. Import the Updated Widget

2. Navigate to your `figbud` folder
3. Select the `manifest.json` file
4. Click **Open**

### 3. Verify Import Success
- Check the console for debug messages:
  - Open **Widgets â†’ Development â†’ Open console**
  - You should see:
    ```
    [FigBud] Starting widget initialization...
    [FigBud] Widget components loaded
    [FigBud] Registering widget...
    [FigBud] Widget registered successfully!
    ```

### 4. Use the Widget
1. Open the widgets panel (right sidebar â†’ Resources â†’ Widgets)
2. Look for "FigBud Widget" in your widgets
3. Drag it onto your canvas
4. The widget should appear with:
   - Dark theme (#0A0A0A background)
   - "FigBud" title with robot emoji
   - Free badge
   - Chat toggle button (ðŸ’¬)

### 5. Test Widget Functionality

2. You should see:
   - Welcome message
   - Quick Create buttons (Button, Card, Input)
   - Sandbox mode button

## Troubleshooting

### Widget Not Appearing in Panel
- Make sure you're using Figma Desktop (not browser)
- Check the manifest ID is unique: `figbud-widget-once-ui-v3`
- Try quitting and reopening Figma

### Console Errors
- Check the console for any error messages
- Look for "[FigBud]" prefixed messages
- If you see "widget missing call to figma.widget.register", the build may have failed

### Widget Crashes
- Check if `dist/code.js` exists and is not empty
- Run `npm run build:widget` to rebuild
- Make sure no TypeScript/React code is in the widget file

## What Changed
1. **Manifest**: Removed `ui` field, changed ID to be unique
2. **Build**: Created dedicated widget build without plugin UI
3. **Debug**: Added console logging to track initialization
4. **Structure**: Pure widget without hybrid plugin functionality
