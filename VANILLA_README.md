## 💡 Why Vanilla JS?

After extensive testing, we found that Figma's plugin sandbox has strict limitations:
- Cannot load external JavaScript files
- Complex React builds cause parsing errors
- Figma uses `document.write()` which doesn't handle modern bundled code well

The vanilla JS approach:
- ✅ Works perfectly with Figma's constraints
- ✅ Maintains beautiful Once UI styling
- ✅ Fast and lightweight
- ✅ No build complexity
- ✅ Easy to debug and modify

## 🤝 Contributing

The vanilla architecture is simple and extensible:
- Add new components in `code-vanilla.ts`
- Style them in `ui-vanilla.html`
- Build with `npm run build:vanilla`

Enjoy your beautiful, functional Figma plugin! 🎉
