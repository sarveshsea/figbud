# ðŸš¨ Final Steps to Fix API Calls

## Current Status
âœ… Backend server is running on port 3000
âœ… API endpoints work (tested with debug-api.js)
âœ… localhost:3000 URL is in the built plugin code
âœ… DeepSeek off-hours discount is active

## You MUST Do These Steps:

### 1. **Completely Remove and Re-import Plugin**
```
1. In Figma: Plugins â†’ Development â†’ FigBud â†’ Remove from Figma
2. Close Figma completely
3. Reopen Figma
4. Plugins â†’ Development â†’ Import plugin from manifest
5. Select manifest.json from figbud folder
```

### 2. **Open Browser Console BEFORE Running Plugin**
```
1. In Figma: View â†’ Developer â†’ JavaScript Console
2. Clear the console (Cmd+K or right-click â†’ Clear)
3. Keep console open
```

### 3. **Run the Plugin and Watch Console**
```
1. Run FigBud plugin
2. Look for these logs in console:
   - [OpenRouterService] Backend available: true/false
   - If false, there's still a connection issue
```

### 4. **Test a Message**
```
1. Type: "Create a primary button"
2. Watch console for:
   - [OpenRouterService] Calling backend API...
   - [OpenRouterService] Backend response: {...}
```

## If Still Getting Robotic Responses:

### Check Network Tab
1. In browser console, go to Network tab
2. Clear network log
3. Send a message in chat
4. Look for POST request to localhost:3000/api/chat/message
5. If no request, the plugin isn't making API calls

### Check for CORS Errors
1. Look in console for errors like:
   - "blocked by CORS policy"
   - "Failed to fetch"
   - "net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED"

### Verify Server is Still Running
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

## The Fix Should Work Because:
- âœ… Server is running and responding
- âœ… API endpoints are working
- âœ… URL is in the built code
- âœ… CORS is configured for development

**The plugin just needs to be completely reloaded in Figma to pick up the changes!**
