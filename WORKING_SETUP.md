## What to Test in Figma

1. **Reload the Plugin** (important!)
   - Close and reopen the plugin in Figma
   - This ensures it detects the running backend

2. **Check Browser Console**
   - Open: View → Developer → JavaScript Console
   - Look for: `[OpenRouterService] Backend available: true`
   - If it says `false`, the plugin can't reach the server

3. **Send a Test Message**
   - Type: "Create a primary button"
   - You should get a detailed, teacher-like response (not robotic)
   - Check console for API logs

4. **Verify in Supabase**
   - Go to your Supabase dashboard
   - Check Table Editor → `chat_sessions`
   - You should see the conversation with ID `220b97c5-...`

## Troubleshooting

If still getting robotic responses:
1. Make sure server is running: `ps aux | grep tsx`
2. Check plugin console for errors
3. Try hard refresh: Close plugin → Clear Figma cache → Reopen

## Keep Server Running
The server must stay running for API calls to work:
```bash
# Keep this terminal open:
tsx server/index.ts
```

Or run in background:
```bash
nohup tsx server/index.ts > server.log 2>&1 &
```
