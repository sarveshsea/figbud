# Supabase Integration Status

## Current Issue: Invalid API Key ❌

The Supabase API keys provided are being rejected with a 401 error. This means either:
1. The keys are from a different Supabase project
2. The keys have been regenerated/revoked
3. The project URL doesn't match the keys

## What's Configured:
- ✅ Database service (`/server/services/database.ts`) is properly set up
- ✅ Chat route integrates with database service
- ✅ Environment variables are loaded
- ❌ API keys are invalid for the project

## To Fix This:

### Option 1: Get Correct API Keys
1. Go to your Supabase project: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/faummrgmlwhfehylhfvx/settings/api
2. Copy the correct keys:
   - **Project URL**: Should be `https://faummrgmlwhfehylhfvx.supabase.co`
   - **Anon Key**: For public/client-side access
   - **Service Key**: For server-side operations (keep secret!)

### Option 2: Create New Supabase Project
If the project doesn't exist or you don't have access:

1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Create a new project
3. Copy the new project URL and keys
4. Update `.env` with new credentials
5. Run the SQL schema in the new project

## Current Implementation:

### Database Service (`/server/services/database.ts`)
- ✅ Stores chat sessions
- ✅ Stores created components
- ✅ Provides conversation history
- ✅ Tracks component statistics

### Integration Points:
1. **Chat Route** (`/server/routes/chat.ts`):
   - Calls `databaseService.storeChatMessage()` after each message
   - Stores component creation events
   
2. **Tables Required**:
   - `chat_sessions` - Stores all conversations
   - `components_created` - Tracks UI components
   - `api_cache` - Caches AI responses
   - `api_calls` - Logs API usage

## Without Supabase:
The app still works but you lose:
- Chat history persistence
- Analytics on component usage
- API usage tracking
- Cost monitoring
- User insights

## Quick Test:
Once you have valid keys, test with:
```bash
node test-supabase.js
```

You should see:
```
✅ Table 'chat_sessions' exists
✅ Insert successful
```
